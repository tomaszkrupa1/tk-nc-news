## Set Up

For security reasons, environment files are gitignored.
In order to set up the environment, the cloned user will need to set up two files named:

1. **.env.test**
2. **.env.development**

Within these files insert the following

**PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>**

the database names can be found in ./db/setup.sql
